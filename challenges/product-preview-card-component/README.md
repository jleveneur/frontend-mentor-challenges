### What I learned

<!-- BEM -->

I learned how to use the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention to name my classes in a way that is descriptive and easy to understand. This makes it easier to maintain and scale my CSS code.

```css
.product-card {
  /* Styles for the block */
}

.product-card__image {
  /* Styles for the element */
}

.product-card__title {
  /* Styles for the element */
}
```
