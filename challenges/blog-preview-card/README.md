## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the `clamp()` function in CSS to set a font size that is responsive to the viewport width. This is useful for setting a minimum and maximum font size, as well as a font size that is proportional to the viewport width.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 2.5rem);
}
```
